# Fake And Real News

There are various words that surround the meaning of fake news such as hoax, rumor, even
myth. However fake news is the term that has proven more useful for both social and
academic purposes.
The “news” in Fake News has an agreed upon definition: new information reported about
important events. Fake news is false information reported about important events. But this
falseness must be provable, otherwise the categorization of the news as fake has no meaning.
Hence, for the concerns of this overview, fake news is provably false information reported
about important events.
And whether or not it is maliciously and intentionally reported, as long as the information is
false, the persons involved in the event can have undesired consequences because of it

However, there is a different spirit and momentum of propagation about fake news that is
maliciously planted. This type of fake news is the one that is always dangerous.
There are thus some variables that, depending on their state, can lead to information being
fake news. Intent, importance, relevance/recency, and newness. Various kinds of fake news
spring from different instances of these variables.
